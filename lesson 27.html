    		An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage...The dead body of Mumtaz has placed at the Banks of River Yamuna. As he promised he constructed the Taj Mahal over her grave. Even Shah Jahan dead body was laid beside Mumtaz Tomb. The love between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz made a beautiful monument which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World..The Taj Mahal, which was constructed in 1632 by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, had been initially named 'Roza-e-Munavvara' which means Unique Building, but was then renamed by Shah Jahan as Taj Mahal as a loving tribute to his wife for whom his love surpassed all belief</p>

    		 The Taj Mahal was built as a tomb for Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”) by her husband, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58). She died in childbirth in 1631, after having been the emperor's inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. Even Shah Jahan dead body was laid beside Mumtaz Tomb. The love between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz made a beautiful monument which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World..The Taj Mahal, which was constructed in 1632 by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, had been initially named 'Roza-e-Munavvara' which means Unique Building, but was then renamed by Shah Jahan as Taj Mahal as a loving tribute to his wife for whom his love surpassed all belief..</p>
